# Calorie Counter using Gen AI

This project leverages the power of GenAI to estimate the caloric content of a meal from an image. It utilizes Google's Gemini-Pro-Vision model, Streamlit, and PIL.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to provide an easy and efficient way for individuals to track their caloric intake. By simply taking a snapshot of their meal and uploading it to our web application, users can receive an estimate of the total number of calories in their meal.

## Features

- **Calorie Estimation**: Using Google's Gemini-Pro-Vision model, the application estimates the caloric content of the food in the uploaded image.
- **Dietary Assessment**: The application provides feedback on whether the meal is suitable for weight loss goals based on the estimated caloric content.
- **Exercise Recommendations**: To help balance caloric intake, the application suggests exercises that can help burn off the calories from a heavy meal.

Please note that the calorie estimation and exercise recommendations provided by this application should not replace professional medical advice.
